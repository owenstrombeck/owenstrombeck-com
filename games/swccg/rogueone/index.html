					<strong>Why?</strong>
				</summary>
				<p>
					<p>
						I was introduced to the Star Wars Customizable Card Game by Decipher as a child in 
						the mid 90s when a family member gave me the Premiere Introductory Two-Player 
						Starter Set as a birthday gift.  I was instantly enamored with the cards.  I spent 
						about 6 hours studying the rulebook, reading through all the cards, and then moving 
						the cards around on our table endeavoring to make sense of the instructions to no 
						avail.  This was the start of the most long-running and influential “hobby” of my life.
					</p>
					<p>
						It wasn’t until several years later that I would be able to play the game correctly - but 
						even before then the imagery, lore and gametext on each card held my attention like 
						nothing else.  Much of my youthful vocabulary was gained through my repeated study of 
						the cards.  I made my closest lifelong friends when we realized we all collected Star 
						Wars cards.  The concepts of event listeners and handlers, linear flow and interruption 
						mechanics that this game introduced made these topics seem natural when they arose in 
						software development.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a child, my friends and I made dream cards by cutting bits of paper out and gluing or 
						taping them over some sacrificial real cards.  After college, my closest friends from 
						childhood and I would gather together one weekend each winter to catch-up and play this 
						game again.  I started getting a bit more advanced with my dream-card production using 
						photo-editing software tools and would make a handful each year to share during our 
						reunion weekends.  As the tools, resources, and digital materials I had access to allowed 
						my results to creep ever closer to replicating the original cards' look - I started toying 
						with the idea of making my own custom complete expansion set.

					<strong>Goals and Boundaries</strong>
				</summary>
				<p>
					<p>
						My goal was to create a set explicitly for the purpose of facilitating a sealed or 
						draft play event.  I came up with the following guideposts / boundaries:
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>-The set must be self-contained.</strong>  No mechanic referenced in the gametext of a card in 
						the set can require a card from outside the set.  All of the themes and strategies 
						introduced or implied by the cards must be feasible using only the cards in the set.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>-Each of the set’s themes must be represented in a volume that is useful.</strong>  If there is 
						a theme of “x” - it must be present across enough cards, must have enough interactions 
						to make it “feel” useful to the players.  I admit I broke this guidepost a bit 
						with K-2SO being an undercover spy - my excitement to include that mechanic got the 
						better of me.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>-The set must encourage “board action”.</strong>  Meaning the set composition is heavy toward characters, 
						starships, and vehicles.  Gametext should promote battles, and the benefits and bonuses 
						for Force drains should be done in a way to entice the opponent to try to stop you through 
						battles instead of setting up a drain race.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>-The cards must “feel” like cards from the “Endor” / “Death Star II” era.</strong>  This is my 
						personal preference for a nostalgic feeling.  To me, this means several things: 
						Gametext must not contain any shortcut symbols or abbreviations.  Function density on 
						cards cannot exceed the space available limited by writing out the full gametext like 
						was done in that era.  No upkeep costs can exist.  No gametext mechanics that didn’t 
						exist by this era can be used. I broke this rule for one card as well - "Looks Like We 
						Found Saw's Rebels". Given the intention of the set supporting draft play, I decided that allowing the 
						player to look before deciding if Used or Lost was worth bending this rule.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>-The set must play well as a Draft event.</strong>  The function, volume, and availability 
						(in the setting of a sealed or draft event) of the cards in the set must allow for a pace of play 
						that makes a 50-minute game time limit reasonable.  Ergo, some acceleration of location deployment 
						and some reasonable volume of cards that enable you to search your deck for other cards should exist.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						With the above goals and boundaries in mind, I decided that the Jedha and Scarif locales 
						in Rogue One could create a perfect setting.  I had wild dreams of a three-expansion arc 
						(“Rogue One”, then “Jedha”, and finally “Scarif”) like Decipher used to do - but after 
						some initial exploration of the time and work required to make these cards, I decided a 
						single self-contained set that created a “cube” to draft (or play sealed) from was the 
						right format for me to pursue.
					</p>
				</p>

					<strong>Set Composition</strong>
				</summary>
				<p>
					<p>
						I used the Jabba’s Palace Sealed Deck as the inspiration to provide each player with 
						a “Fixed” pack of cards that would enable some minimum needs for deck-construction 
						(an objective, locations, a starting interrupt, and a handful of other cards) and then 
						4 “booster” packs.  In working out the drafting logistics, I felt that some of the Fixed 
						cards also needed to be available in the booster packs for the sake of drafting strategy 
						and deck-building flexibility.  An example is the dark side “***Death Trooper” character 
						card.  One copy is given to each dark side player in their Fixed pack, but it also is 
						distributed within the booster packs as an Uncommon card.  There ended up being a couple 
						cards like this on each side.
					</p>

					<p>
						There are <strong>128 cards total</strong> (64 Dark and 64 Light)
						</br>Each side has:
						</br>-16 Fixed (of which 2 are also Uncommon and 2 are also Common)
						</br>-8 Rare
						</br>-16 Uncommon
						</br>-28 Common
					</p>

					<p>
						This allows an 8-player cube (4 Dark players and 4 Light players) to have the following composition:
						</br>-4 Dark Side 16-card Fixed Packs
						</br>-4 Light Side 16-card Fixed Packs
						</br>-16 Dark Side 11-card Expansion Packs (4 per Dark player)
						</br>-16 Light Side 11-card Expansion Packs (4 per Light player)
					</p>

					<p>
						Each Expansion pack is made up of 11 cards as:
						</br>-1 Rare card
						</br>-3 Uncommon cards
						</br>-7 Common cards
					</p>

					<p>
						This means:
						</br>-each Rare card is present 2 times in the Expansion packs
						</br>-each Uncommon card is present 3 times in the Expansion packs
						</br>-each Common card is present 4 times in the Expansion packs
					</p>
				</p>

					<strong>Playtesting Lessons Learned</strong>
				</summary>
				<p>
					<p>
						My friends TJ, Joe, and Patrick helped me playtest the set several times.  For the 
						first session I had created two objective cards for each side; one that focused on 
						Jedha and control over kyber crystals, and the other focused on the battle of Scarif.  
						During the session it became clear that - while it was nice to have the option to make a decision
						for yourself on which locale and strategy you wanted to pursue - the volume of content 
						a player needed to read, consume, learn, and consider to do so was far too much for an 
						event setting.  
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the many adjustments I made before the second playtesting session 
						was to reduce to one objective for each side.  Given the feedback from which mechanics 
						and themes were most interesting and enjoyable for the players - I decided to keep the 
						Dark side Jedha objective, and the Light side Scarif objective.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the second and third playtesting sessions, I made many more subtle adjustments to 
						costs, values, and gametext details in order to balance the two sides.  I won't list off 
						each of the changes here - but I do want to explicitly thank TJ, Joe, and Patrick for all 
						of their help and feedback!
