				<h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
					<br>
					Roll the Food Type and Customer Type dice each turn to find out which 
                    type of food is in-demand and which customer types are especially hungry.<br><br>

                    Collect money for selling your food, and use that money to buy more food 
                    trucks to expand your offerings and bring your delicious food to more 
                    customers throughout the city.<br><br>

                    As you drive your trucks around - you will reveal city block tiles and find
                    new customers.<br><br>

                    Additionally, you will have the chance to both influence the customers of
                    the city and interfere with your opponents' schemes using Action Cards!<br><br>

                    Once the city has been fully explored - the player with the most food
                    trucks (and the most money) is the victor!
