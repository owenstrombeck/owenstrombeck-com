				<h2>
					Original Games Production Update:
				</h2>
				<p>
					I had previously been using TheGameCrafter to produce and distribute these four games - however they 
					have recently changed their production methods to use laser-cutting for paper components (cards, 
					cardboard, chits, etc).<br><br>
					Each of my games currently includes some of these components and the result is 
					that the pieces arrive with black soot around all of the edges that rubs off on hands, tables, other pieces,
					and is generally a very unpleasant experience for the customer.  Additionally frustrating is the time it takes
					to clean each individual piece.<br><br>
					
					To me, this is an unacceptable experience to place on anyone willing to 
					purchase one of my games - especially at the premium prices that are required given the high cost of TGC. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Ergo - <strong>I have removed my games from their site</strong> - and I am in the process of finding a different 
					production solution.  At this time, you cannot purchase any of these games - instead <strong>I have made 
					them all available for free below as print and play games</strong>!

					<strong>Some Background...</strong>
				</summary>
				<p>
					<p>
						As a child, I constantly made up 'house rules' for my favorite board games. I introduced 
						'Leader' and 'Hero' unit types with custom rules to the classic game Risk. I created 
						homemade cards featuring my friends as characters in the original Star Wars CCG by Decipher. 
						This continued in larger and larger scopes until one day I decided I should just make my own 
						board game that combined all of my favorite mechanics and pieces from other games into one 
						game to rule them all!
					</p>
					<p>
						I started writing rules and cutting out paper-prototype pieces, and after about 20 hours 
						realized that finishing this behemoth of a game I was designing would take several hundred 
						more hours. I put that idea on the shelf and decided I wanted to make a small game in order 
						to learn all the details needed to complete making a game. Something relatively simple - 
						just a few mechanics - that could be played in less than an hour. The focus was no longer 
						"make the best game" - it was now "finish making a game". Build something small (a done 
						increment, if you will), then iterate based on what I learned.
					</p>
					<p>
						That first game was Square Tactics - a set of 24 square cards with numbers on each of their 
						four sides. The game was inspired by the Triple Triad mini-game inside of Final Fantasy 8. 
						The differentiator I introduced was simply that when you play your card, you must "process" 
						the numbers on your card linearly - comparing them to the cards adjacent to it starting with 
						the number at the top of your card and continuing clockwise. If your number is higher, you 
						capture your opponent's card, if yours is lower you stop processing and can't check any of 
						your card's remaining numbers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Through the experience of making this game - I learned a lot of details about component design, 
						writing clear rules, layouts for components and rulebooks, packaging design, branding, 
						production logistics, and more. Since then, I have iterated on Square Tactics four times, 
						adding game text abilities to each card, expanding the number of character cards from 24 to 
						72, adding action cards, and adding support for up to 4 players!
					</p>
					<p>
						I have since completed 3 other games - Food Truck City, Defcon Zombies, and Sabotage Pizza - 
						and they are all available print-on-demand and drop-shipped through TheGameCrafter in Madison, WI.

						It is the distant future and rampant overpopulation of Earth is having
						disastrous effects.  Ancient texts foretell of 8 constellations that -
						when charted - will reveal a path to a system containing a verdant
						planet with abundant water, landmasses, and natural resources.  
						The nations on the space council have agreed to a tenuous treaty to
						halt hostilities and cooperate in exploring the systems within reach
						of Earth.  Take to the stars with hope - but beware - the reaches of
						space contains a threat unbeknownst to humanity...
					</p>
					<p>
						Cooperatively explore unknown space - flipping over hexes to
						reveal what each system contains as you move. When you
						reveal a Zombie system - it will start generating zombies each
						turn to swarm out across the galaxy. Buy new ships and unlock
						upgrades to fight off the zombie swarm. Race to discover all of
						the constellations before the zombies overrun Earth!
