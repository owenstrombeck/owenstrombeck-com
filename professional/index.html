				<h5>Education and the start of my career</h5>
				<p>
					I went to the Milwaukee School of Engineering where I completed a BS in Computer Engineering.  
					I worked on campus as a Resident Advisor, an English as a Second Language tutor, and a Learning 
					Resource Center tutor for advanced Calculus, Physics, and Engineering courses.  During my sophomore 
					year I participated in a “Bug Stomp” event one weekend - where teams of students used, tested, 
					and investigated the functionality of several demo software products with limited visibility 
					grey-box code bases.  The goal of each team was to discover the most issues, document them, and 
					attempt to reverse engineer how and why they occurred.  This was basically an intro to Software 
					QA/Test Engineering gamified in a group setting.  In the aftermath of this event I started my 
					career with an internship in Test Engineering with a focus on automation at Direct Supply.  I 
					continued working part time during the school year and (more than) full time over the summers 
					until graduating, wherein I took a full-time position as a Software Test Engineer.

				<h5>Growing and My First Startup Experience</h5>
				<p>
					Over the next several years I continued to gain skills, knowledge, and experience in test 
					automation and software development roles at Zywave, Centare, and Health Payment Systems.  
					I am especially thankful for the experience gained while working with Vesuvius Technologies 
					- a start-up at the time where we built and operated an auction website.  The experience of 
					being part of a tiny team building a new product, rolling it out, managing the support and 
					being involved in customer service directly, going to datacenters and managing our own hardware 
					(pre azure and aws ubiquity!), learning about and implementing data-warehousing, dimensional 
					modeling and the Kimball methods, all contributed to a base understanding and experience with 
					product development and team dynamics that have been a great foundation for my professional 
					growth since then.

				<h5>Consulting, Coaching, Leadership, and Scrum Mastering</h5>
				<p>
					I am very fortunate to have spent several years working at Centare - a consulting company that 
					offered full software development teams as a service as well as delivered agile and scrum training and 
					coaching engagements.   I took on a leadership role within their Development Center side of the business (the full development 
					team services wing of the company), as well as fulfilling the scrum master accountability for 
					many of the teams - and staying involved with development and testing activities as my teams, 
					clients and projects needed.  The consulting model that Centare had in place allowed me the 
					opportunity to work with over 20 different client companies - from several small startups that 
					needed help implementing their first product, to some of the largest companies in the world 
					(Siemens, GE, Johnson Controls, etc...)

				<h5>Startup and Pandemic</h5>
				<p>
					I have since had several great opportunities to continue growing and learning - including 
					while helping to build and lead the development teams at a startup focused on creating a 
					health-data platform that pivoted into covid symptom monitoring and workplace compliance 
					reporting during the pandemic.  We built and launched a product, onboarded users and customers, 
					and supported the product through growth from 0 to 20,000 monthly active users and from 0 to 
					over 6-figures in monthly revenue (and our company internally growing from 5 total people when 
					I joined to 80 employees two and a half years later).  The leadership, technical, and process 
					challenges through this were a great addition to my experience.

				<h5>scrum.org</h5>
				<p>
					I am currently partnering with 
					<a href="https://scrum.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scrum.org</a>
					- fulfilling the scrum master accountability for their teams internally.  I have some limited 
					availability to engage in coaching, mentoring, or consulting capacities in the realms of product 
					development, organizational agility, leadership, team and organizational process, and more.  
					If you are interested in having a conversation to see if we are the right fit for each other, 
					connect with me and send a message on 
					<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/owenstrombeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linkedin</a>
